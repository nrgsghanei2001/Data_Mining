# Data Mining Mini-Projects

## Overview
These mini-projects were completed as part of my Data Mining course at university. 
The tasks focus on fundamental techniques and algorithms in data mining.
Each project is a basic implementation aimed at demonstrating key concepts and methods.

## Attribute Analysis for Classification Task

- **Objective:** Conduct a detailed analysis of attributes to see which one is better for classification of the given dataset.
- **Approach:** 
  - Evaluated the impact of different attributes on classification performance.

## K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, DBSCAN Clustering

- **Objective:** Apply various clustering algorithms to analyze and group data.
- **Approach:** 
  - Implemented K-Means for partition-based clustering.
  - Utilized Fuzzy C-Means for soft clustering where data points can belong to multiple clusters.
  - Applied DBSCAN for density-based clustering to identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes.
  - Compared the performance and results of each clustering method.

## Multi-Layered Perceptron

- **Objective:** Develop a Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) for classification tasks.
- **Approach:** 
  - Constructed a neural network with multiple layers.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- **Objective:** Implement PCA for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.
- **Approach:** 
  - Applied PCA to reduce the number of features while preserving data variance.
  - Analyzed the impact of dimensionality reduction on model performance and data interpretation.

## Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Cross-Validation

- **Objective:** Compare and evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms for classification.
- **Approach:** 
  - Implemented Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
  - Used cross-validation techniques to assess model performance and prevent overfitting.
  - Compared the effectiveness of each algorithm in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.
  - use confusion matrix to show results.
